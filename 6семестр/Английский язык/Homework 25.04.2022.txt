REVIEW
	"12 angry man" is courtdown drama film directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, adapted from 1954 teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Starring Henry Fonda (who also produced the film with Reginald Rose), Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, and Jack Warden.
	In summary, this film is about twelve men in charge of deciding whether or not an 18-year-old boy is guilty of first-degree murder…of his father. The film starts in the courtroom with the judge stating that it’s the juror's duty to “sit down and separate the facts from the fancy.” The jury retires to discuss the seemingly unanimous verdict of guilty. After the first polling, all vote guilty except one: Juror #8. He votes not guilty because he isn’t sure…and that’s all it takes. After expressing his desire for discussion, Juror #8 slowly convinces more and more of the jury to hear his arguments, swaying them to believe the boy is not guilty.
	I especially like this motion picture because it proved that having lots of special effects and expensive scenery is not necessary in order to create a masterpiece - you only need camera, couple of actors and your brain make something impossible, just like the main character of this movie - Juror #8. Thus the director created a metaphor about himself without realizing it.
	My honest recommendation for anyone is to watch this movie. Not only because is it an intriguing plot, but this film possesses a large quantity of wisdom and life lesson. Additionally, "12 Angry Men" storytelling method is one of the most impressive I have ever seen. Should you watch this movie, you will understand me.
