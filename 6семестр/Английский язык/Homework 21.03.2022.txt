The role of women and men has changed enormously over the last 30 years.
But do they have similar responsibilities these days?

30 years ago our lives were absolutely different.
While boys were educated to be the head of the family and earn a salary,
girls were brought up to be good mothers and wives.
Consequently men used to work all day outside the house and women would look after their children and the house.
It used to be absolutely normally that men didn’t know neither cook, nor iron
and working woman was not a usual phenomenon.

Nowdays in Russia role of women and men has changed dramatically.
As boys and girls are brought up to study and get a profession that
they can have a successful career in the future. As a result, both of them when
they grow up, would work outside the house. However women usually have jobs with less
responsibility than men because employers see extra expense in them because of maternity leave.
Another major difference is that in the marriage women and men have to
share housework and education of their children. 
Therefore, men have learnt to do a lot of things.
Now we sweep, dust or dress their children.
Nevertheless, It´s still understandable that women are the main responsible
for their children and the house.

Although nowadays women have more responsibilities then 30 years ago.
I can't objectively evaluate this situation but I belive that any changes lead to bright future.
