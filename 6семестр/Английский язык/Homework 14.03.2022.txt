My childhood memory

	When I was about six of seven my parents decided to go to Egypt and to take me with them.
It was my first travel abroad and it was afraid of flying on the plain. 
But when we had boarded the plain I fell asleep instantly and now I don't remeber not a second of that flight.
	After a week of laying on the beach my parents decided to make take part in tour to the Pyramids.
This Wonder of the Ancient World located in Giza. It took six hours to get there from our hotel by bus.
It was very hard for six year old boy to sit so much time in stuffy bus.
So my organizm desided to turn itself off and I fell asleep onw whole way time. 
When we had finished sightseeing in Giza I turned off again. 
	Since that time I am always about to fall asleep when ride in any kind of transport.
