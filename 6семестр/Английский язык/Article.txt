	The role of women and men has changed enormously over the last 30 years.
But do they have similar responsibilities these days?

	30 years ago our lives were absolutely different.
While boys were educated to be the head of the family and earn a salary,
girls were brought up to be good mothers and wives.
Consequently men used to work all day outside the house and women would look after their children and the house.
It used to be absolutely normal that men didn’t know neither how to cook, nor how to iron
and a working woman was not a usual phenomenon.

	Nowdays in Russia the roles of women and men have changed dramatically.
Both boys and girls are brought up to study and get a profession
so they can have a successful career and work outside the house.

	However, women usually have jobs with less responsibility than men
because employers see extra expense in them because of maternity leave.

	Another major difference is that in the marriage women and men have to
share housework and education of our children. 
Therefore, men have learnt to do a lot of things.
Now we sweep, dust or dress our children.
Nevertheless, It´s still understandable that women are the main responsible ones
for their children and the house.

	Although nowadays women have more responsibilities than 30 years ago.
I can't objectively evaluate this situation but I believe that any changes lead to bright future.
