When I was about eight or nine, my grandparents were living not far from my home 
but they went to countryside every summer.
My parents used to force me to join them every time they were going there. So I just had no choice.
I never loved being there because I had to help my grandmother to work in the garden.
Nevertheless, sometimes if was interesting. 
For example when me and my grandfather went fishing.
That time I was amazed when I was let to hold fishing rod.
I remember that I had been sititng with fishing rod for an hour on the lake 
when my grandfather told me that I had forgotten to put a bite. 
I also loved riding granddad's motorcycle. Unfortunately such possibility 
was able only when my grandmother was in the town.

In a word, spending summertimetime in countryside was not as bad as I used to think those days.
